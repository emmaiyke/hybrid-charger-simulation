The simulation integrates voltage regulation, efficiency optimization, and thermal analysis, maintaining 5V (±0.5V) output with 95% conversion efficiency. It processes battery (12V), solar (14.4V), and AC (15V) inputs, monitoring temperature from 25°C baseline for system optimization and longevity.
